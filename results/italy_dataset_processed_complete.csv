The first result is to increase the access opportunities of women and people with disabilities to income-generating activities (AGR) through micro-credit and entrepreneurial activities supported by an incubator of micro-enterprises (start-ups). Considering the prevalence of agricultural activities in the area, the agro-ecological activities that have already given excellent results in the pilot phase will be expanded.The second expected result is linked to the capitalization of the social networks of the SAC (Community Alarm System) in the Gabu region. As part of the AID10953, project managed by AIFO, a sensitization campaign has been launched on gender violence, women's and people with disabilities rights through an institutional dialogue with the Federation of Associations for the Defence of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in Guinea Bissau (FADPD / GB).This initiative will expand activities in the field of gender-based violence prevention and inclusion of disability by enhancing dialogue mechanisms, increasing the number of self-help groups. These activities will serve as a hub to involve beneficiaries and families, in a path of behaviour change already successfully applied in many African countries for women's empowerment and prevention of violence, especially domestic violence.The impact of the initiative is not limited to produce direct benefits for families, linked to the improvement of the economic condition of women and the reduction of domestic violence. In fact, through the involvement and support of traditional authorities, it is expected to induce in the community a spirit of emulation that determines the change of gender roles. The change will have a very important impact on young people, obstructing gender-based violence, towards building a resilient, productive and respectful community of rights and equal opportunities.",0,0,0,0,yes,"Project includes actions related to agro-ecological activities and women's empowerment, which can have positive impacts on the environment.",2918,2019,italy,Guinea-bissau / JUNTAS: empowerment of women in the Region of Gabu,guinea-bissau,,africa,161504.83,144226.5,161504.83,Committed,Oda,cross-cutting,Grant,Cross-cutting,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

"This happens for the huge collection of Egyptian antiquities, more than 140.000 artefacts produced in 5000 years, stored in the basement of the Egyptian Museum of Cairo, which include objects belonging to the royal dynasties and to every-day life as statues, stelae, coffins, vessels of pottery and stone, weapons, amulets, seals, etc... The metallic artefacts include more than 100.000 coins, bronze statues, iron and copper tools, funerary objects. The idea is to take advantage of the experience in cultural heritage safeguard and valorisation gained by the Italian and Egyptian researchers, who have participated to common European INCO-Med projects along with the CNR (Italy) and other partners from the
Mediterranean basin (Greece, Turkey, Tunisia, Syria) to catalogue these artefacts and to develop tailored conservation and storage procedures. This way the project could be an important seeding point for a larger cooperation in the cultural heritage field. The majority of the artefacts stored in the basement have neither been catalogued, nor submitted to any chemical-physical analysis, and left for tenths of years in an uncontrolled storage environment. A detailed survey will start from the metallic artefacts, which are in serious dangerous conditions; the artefacts will be entered in the museum’s database, thus enabling the retrieval of information regarding any item both electronically and manually.
