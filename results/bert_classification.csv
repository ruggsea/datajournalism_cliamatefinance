In urban and building terms, the program aims to achieve its objectives of better livability and enhancement of the heritage through restructuring and redevelopment: the most valuable residential buildings used by less well-off social groups; social service structures; and related urban furniture located in the immediate vicinity of the main square of the historic center (Plaza Augustin Cebreco).To this end, the studies and designs necessary to detail and quantify the executive interventions (today evaluated with preliminary plans), for the civil works of restructuring, restoration and requalification as well as specialist technical assistance actions aimed at adapt the construction and restoration techniques used locally to more advanced levels of effectiveness.In social and employment terms, the program aims to achieve its objectives, of better liveability and enhancement of the heritage, through technical cooperation and training and operational assistance with regard to the same structures of the OCC, but above all with regards to the construction workers working in the territory, workers in the tourism sector and in support of the employment developments that the Cuban government is promoting throughout the country.To this end, preliminary joint evaluations must be carried out with the Municipality, with the OCC and with all the local organizations that operate in the workplace and social development, to identify the most sensitive sectors, in terms of employment development in tourism, craftsmanship and the enhancement of cultural aspects and traditions related to specificity."

The metallic artefacts include more than 100.000 coins, bronze statues, iron and copper tools, funerary objects. The idea is to take advantage of the experience in cultural heritage safeguard and valorisation gained by the Italian and Egyptian researchers, who have participated to common European INCO-Med projects along with the CNR (Italy) and other partners from the
Mediterranean basin (Greece, Turkey, Tunisia, Syria) to catalogue these artefacts and to develop tailored conservation and storage procedures. This way the project could be an important seeding point for a larger cooperation in the cultural heritage field. The majority of the artefacts stored in the basement have neither been catalogued, nor submitted to any chemical-physical analysis, and left for tenths of years in an uncontrolled storage environment. A detailed survey will start from the metallic artefacts, which are in serious dangerous conditions; the artefacts will be entered in the museum’s database, thus enabling the retrieval of information regarding any item both electronically and manually. Chemical-physical analyses will be performed in order to identify the degradation mechanisms and establish best practices for the cultural heritage management.
