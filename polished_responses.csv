"The overall objective of the proposal is to contribute to strengthening the most vulnerable people of Guinea Bissau in reducing poverty and exclusion. The specific objective is to facilitate the process of inclusion and empowerment of women and people with disabilities, with particular focus on those victims of violence.

The metallic artefacts include more than 100.000 coins, bronze statues, iron and copper tools, funerary objects.
