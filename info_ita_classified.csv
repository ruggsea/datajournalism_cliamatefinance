"Rakhine State has been mainly targeted by Donors with emergency response or humanitarian funds, due to the conflicts in the area and to natural disasters often occurring.

Since its establishment in April 2016, the new Government has tried to address the main causes of the social tensions and instability in the area: poverty and under-development. The importance of sustainable socio-economic development of Rakhine State as a mean for stability has also been raised by the Advisory Commission on Rakhine (KAC), appointed by the Government to investigate on the causes underlying the under-development of Rakhine State. KAC has issued a preliminary report in March 2017 (immediately endorsed by the Government), while the Final Report followed on 24 August 2017.

"The overall objective of the proposal is to contribute to strengthening the most vulnerable people of Guinea Bissau in reducing poverty and exclusion.

These activities will serve as a hub to involve beneficiaries and families, in a path of behaviour change already successfully applied in many African countries for women's empowerment and prevention of violence, especially domestic violence.The impact of the initiative is not limited to produce direct benefits for families, linked to the improvement of the economic condition of women and the reduction of domestic violence. In fact, through the involvement and support of traditional authorities, it is expected to induce in the community a spirit of emulation that determines the change of gender roles.

The metallic artefacts include more than 100.000 coins, bronze statues, iron and copper tools, funerary objects. The idea is to take advantage of the experience in cultural heritage safeguard and valorisation gained by the Italian and Egyptian researchers, who have participated to common European INCO-Med projects along with the CNR (Italy) and other partners from the
Mediterranean basin (Greece, Turkey, Tunisia, Syria) to catalogue these artefacts and to develop tailored conservation and storage procedures.
